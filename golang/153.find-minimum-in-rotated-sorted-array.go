 * Testcase Example:  '[3,4,5,1,2]'
 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 *
 * Find the minimum element.
 *
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
 * Output: 0
