#
# Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per
# line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.
# 
# You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following
# two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)
# 
# You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or
# trailing white spaces.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Assume that file.txt has the following content:
# 
# 
# 987-123-4567
# 123 456 7890
# (123) 456-7890
# 
# 
# Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
# 
# 
# 987-123-4567
# (123) 456-7890
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Read from the file file.txt and output all valid phone numbers to stdout.

# @lc code=end
